MissingOutputException in rule frank_folding in file /home/bigboy/Documents/GitHub/Frankies/Frankies/pipeline.txt, line 10:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
outputs/3_diffusion/structure.pdb (missing locally, parent dir contents: oprep2)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
