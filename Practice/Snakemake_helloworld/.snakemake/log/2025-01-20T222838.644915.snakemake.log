MissingOutputException in rule hello_frankie in file /home/bigboy/Documents/GitHub/Frankies/Frankies/Practice/Snakemake_helloworld/pipeline.txt, line 4:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
hello/world.txt (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
